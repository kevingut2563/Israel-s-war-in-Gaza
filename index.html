        heavy fighting in the area around a large hospital in southern Gaza <b>killed nearly 30 people on Friday</b>, Palestinian state news agency WAFA said. Nasser Hospital — the largest remaining health facility in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis — came under "violent bombardment" by Israeli artillery and military vehicles, according to <a href="https://english.wafa.ps/">WAFA</a> . Several residential buildings near the hospital were reportedly shelled, including one where a family of eight was killed, WAFA said. </p>

    
        <p><b>Ambulance and rescue crews recovered 29 bodies</b> from under the rubble of destroyed homes and in surrounding streets, WAFA reported. The Palestine Red Crescent Society also said Friday that several displaced people were injured in Israeli drone attacks targeting the organization’s headquarters and Al-Amal Hospital, which is close to Nasser Hospital. The United Nations estimated Wednesday that around 7,000 people have sought shelter in and around the Nasser Hospital grounds. </p>
